# CabinsForRent
Website for a fictional company providing cabins for rent.

The site was developed as an 48 hour assignment in an introductional web developer course through HSN.
No external libraries aside from jQuery was allowed, and developing a backend was not part of the assignment.

The theme was "Northern Lights" - hence the green accent colors.
